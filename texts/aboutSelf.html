My name is Panagiotis Mirmigkis. My first coding experience was in C++ but I switched to Java.
I love working with others as a part of a team. I constantly learn new things in both personal and working enviroment. I'm passionate about new technologies and technology in general.
I'm a bit of a geek and nerd but in the end who isn't? My hobbies include gym, hangout with friends, movies, travels and cars! 😁
